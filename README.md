# NYC-Schools-iOS

This is the iOS version of the NYC Schools app

# What is the NYC Schools app?

The NYC Schools app is an app that displays all of the schools in the New York Public school system, as well as more detailed information when the school is tapped on.

# Anything I should know about the iOS version?

Yes! Like other versions, ideally I'd be using the Firebase backend for this, but because I don't want to pay to keep the server running (or make it vulnerable to DDOS attacks and owe Google Cloud a lot of money), all of the data is just loaded locally.
